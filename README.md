# Estimation of Pore Pressure Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code for a machine learning-based project that estimates pore pressure using various ML algorithms. The project uses Python programming language and several libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to estimate pore pressure, a crucial parameter in petroleum engineering, using machine learning algorithms. Pore pressure estimation is important in drilling operations, as it helps to avoid wellbore instability, which can lead to expensive well failures.

The project uses well log data to train several machine learning models and compare their performance in predicting pore pressure. The project also includes data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for machine learning.

## Repository Structure
- data/: Contains the raw and processed data used in the project.
- notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the project code and explanations.
- scripts/: Contains Python scripts used to preprocess data and train machine learning models.
- results/: Contains the results of the project, including plots and evaluation metrics.
